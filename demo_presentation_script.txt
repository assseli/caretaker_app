# Caretaker App Demo Presentation Script

---

**Presenter 1 (Alex):**
Hi everyone, welcome to our demo of the Caretaker App! I’m Alex.

**Presenter 2 (Dana):**
And I’m Dana. Today, we’ll walk you through setting up the project, populating it with data, and using both the interactive SQL tool and our REST API.

---

**Alex:**
Let’s start with the environment setup. First, we need to make sure MySQL is installed and running. On macOS, you can do this with our script:

```
sh setup_mysql.sh
```

**Dana:**
Next, we set up our Python virtual environment and install all dependencies:

```
sh setup_venv.sh
```

---

**Alex:**
Once that’s done, we need to prepare the database. Make sure you’ve created a MySQL user and database, and updated the credentials in `settings.py`.

**Dana:**
With that in place, we can run Django migrations:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

And if you want admin access, create a superuser:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

**Alex:**
Now, let’s fill our database with some realistic demo data. We’ve included a management command for this:

```
python manage.py populate_caregiver
```

**Dana:**
This will generate users, caregivers, members, jobs, and more, all with realistic Russian and Kazakh names.

---

**Alex:**
For those who want to run custom SQL queries, we’ve built an interactive script. Just run:

```
python execute_queries.py
```

**Dana:**
You’ll be prompted to enter DDL, DML, SELECT, or even complex queries, and see the results right in your terminal.

---

**Alex:**
Now, let’s look at the API. Start the Django server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

**Dana:**
All our models are exposed via REST endpoints under `/api/`. For example, to list all caregivers:

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/caregivers/
```

Or to create a new member:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/members/ \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"first_name": "Айгуль", "last_name": "Серикова", "email": "a.serikova@example.com"}'
```

---

**Alex:**
Don’t forget, you can also log in to the Django admin at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to manage all your data through the web interface.

**Dana:**
And that’s our demo! If you have any questions or want to see a specific feature, let us know.

Thanks for watching!

**Dana:**
Thank you!
