Assel Derbissova and Ayaulym Zhumagul

What is done:
we created a caregiver platform (Database and API using Django and MySQL)
we submitted a video in 3 parts:
1) Assel: MySql and Python setup om MacOs using bash scripts, this gave us a physical database to work with using sqlalchemy.
2) Assel: Executing the SQL queries using a python script to incrementally setup and alter the database as needed, while printing the results to the screen.
3) Ayau: Showcasing how to host the platform app on PythonAnywhere, and using a bash script to demo CRUD operations.

we will also submit the following:
1) execute_queries.py (the main script that will run the queries on the mysql database)
Script tasks:
- Connect to the database using sqlalchemy (provided the credentials)
- Create the tables as specified in the DB design diagram
- Populate them with data fit for demostration purposes.
- Execute Select, Update, Delete queries
- Execute complex queries as provided in the assignment
- Commit the changes to the DB

2) The MySql export file (.sql) using the pg_dump utility

Created a Django App that uses a local MySql server (logs in with basic creds), this Django app will serve as an API
using the Django REST framework lib so that we can create the views, serializers and url's.
an endpoint was created foreach model:
- `/api/users/`
- `/api/caregivers/`
- `/api/members/`
- `/api/caretypes/`
- `/api/addresses/`
- `/api/job_ads/`
- `/api/job_applications/`
- `/api/appointments/`
- `/api/messages/`

this app is then hosted on PythonAnywhere.com which is a free public hosting service for web apps.
then for the demo we used a bash script to do CRUD operations on the caregiver api endpoint.

this section will explain the database design and decisions made.
added message table for messaging functionality
added status to some tables
