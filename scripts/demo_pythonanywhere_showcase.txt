# Demo Script: Showcasing Django Hosting on PythonAnywhere (with SQLite)

---

## 1. Introduction
Welcome! In this demo, we’ll showcase how the Django app is hosted live on PythonAnywhere using SQLite as the database. We’ll also perform live CRUD operations on the deployed app using our `demo_crud.sh` script.

---

## 2. PythonAnywhere Hosting Overview
- The Django project is uploaded to PythonAnywhere.
- The app uses SQLite for its database (no server setup required).
- Static files are collected and mapped in the PythonAnywhere Web tab.
- The Database is populated with dummy data using the console
- The app is accessible at: https://asselderbisova.pythonanywhere.com/

## 3. Showcasing the Live Django App
- Open the browser and visit: https://asselderbisova.pythonanywhere.com/
- Show the Django admin at: https://asselderbisova.pythonanywhere.com/admin/
- Point out that the app is running live, and the admin interface is fully functional.

## 4. Performing CRUD Operations via API
- We’ll use the `demo_crud.sh` script to interact with the live API endpoints.
- The script will:
  1. Create a new caregiver (with Kazakh names)
  2. Read the caregiver
  3. Update the caregiver
  4. Delete the caregiver
  5. List all caregivers

- Run the script:
  ```sh
  sh demo_crud.sh
  ```
- Show the output in the terminal, demonstrating that the API is live and functional.

## 5. How Django REST API Works (Short Overview)

- Django REST Framework allows you to build web APIs easily on top of Django models.
- It provides endpoints (URLs) that accept HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and return data in JSON format.
- Each model can have a serializer (to convert between Python objects and JSON) and a viewset (to handle CRUD operations).
- The API endpoints are defined in `urls.py` and are accessible to any HTTP client (browser, curl, Postman, etc.).
- This makes it easy to connect your Django backend to web frontends, mobile apps, or other systems.
