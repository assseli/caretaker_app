# Demo Script: Interactive SQL with execute_queries.py

## 1. Starting the Script

First, make sure your MySQL server is running and your environment is set up. Then, in your terminal, run:

```
python execute_queries.py
```

You’ll see a series of queries, each labeled and printed out for you. For each one, you’ll be prompted:

```
Execute this query? [y/n]:
```

Just press Enter (or type 'y') to run the query, or 'n' to skip it.

## 2. Demo Flow

### a. Table Creation (DDL)
- The first queries create all the necessary tables for the app.
- Example prompt:
  - "Query 1.1: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS caregiver_user ..."
- Press Enter to execute. If the table already exists, nothing will change.

### b. Data Insertion (DML)
- Next, you’ll see bulk INSERT statements for each table, including realistic demo data.
- Example prompt:
  - "Query 2.1: INSERT INTO caregiver_user ..."
- Press Enter to populate the tables. You’ll see a green message showing how many rows were affected.

### c. Updates and Deletes
- The script will offer UPDATE and DELETE queries to modify or remove data.
- Example:
  - "Query 3.1: UPDATE caregiver_user ..."
- Again, press Enter to run and see the result.

### d. SELECT and Complex Queries
- The later queries are SELECT statements, including joins and aggregations.
- When you run these, the results will be printed in green for visibility.
- Example:
  - "Query 5.1: SELECT c.name AS caregiver_name, m.name AS member_name ..."
- You’ll see the output rows directly in your terminal.

---

## 3. Tips for the Demo
- You can skip any query by typing 'n' at the prompt.
- If you just press Enter, the query will run (default is yes).
- All results for SELECT queries are shown in green for easy reading.
- For INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, you’ll see how many rows were affected, also in green.
- If a query returns no results, you’ll see "No results."
- If there’s an error (e.g., a constraint violation), the error message will be shown.

## 4. Example Demo Sequence
1. Run all table creation queries (press Enter for each).
2. Run all data insertion queries (press Enter for each).
3. Run a few UPDATE/DELETE queries to show changes.
4. Run SELECT queries to display data and relationships.
5. Optionally, skip a query to show that skipping is possible.

**Presenter:**
That’s it! With `execute_queries.py`, you can interactively build, populate, and query your database, all from the terminal. It’s a great way to learn SQL and see how your data changes in real time. Thanks for watching!
